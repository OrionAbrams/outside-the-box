# Outside The Box

## Live Site: TBD

### 1. Why / Background
  * Outside The Box is a project I'm working on where there will be a game inside the Phaser3 canvas, where things that happen in the game affect the HTML and CSS OUTSIDE the canvas.
  * This seems like a really fun project with a lot of possibilities, we'll see how far I get.
 ### 2. What / Objectives / User Stories
  * **Technologies**, design through deployment of the application:
    * Phaser 3, HTML, CSS, Jquery
  * **User stories**:
    * To see a lot of unexpected things happen while playing a game, possible including scraping other sites and displaying on the page when something happens in game.
### 3. How / Design Description
  * **How to run**:
    * Simply globally install the npm package "http-server", then type "http-server" in the root folder and navigate to one of the two addresses it is serving in a browser window.
